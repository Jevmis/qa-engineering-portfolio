# 🛡️ Security Testing with OWASP ZAP

> Security is an essential aspect of software quality. My approach combines functional testing with vulnerability assessment to help identify security risks before production deployment.

---

# Overview

In addition to functional and automation testing, I perform baseline security assessments using OWASP ZAP to identify common web application vulnerabilities.

My goal is not to replace dedicated penetration testers but to integrate security validation into the QA process and support secure software development practices.

---

# Security Testing Areas

Typical assessments include:

- Passive Scanning
- Active Scanning
- Authentication Testing
- Session Management
- Cookie Security
- HTTP Header Validation
- SSL/TLS Verification
- Input Validation
- Injection Testing
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Security Misconfiguration
- Information Disclosure

# Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| OWASP ZAP | Security Assessment |
| Browser Proxy | Request Interception |
| Swagger/OpenAPI | Endpoint Discovery |
| Postman | API Validation |
| SQL | Backend Verification |
